## 📌 Project Overview
Organizations handle large volumes of unstructured data such as documents, reports, contracts, and emails. Traditional methods like manual tagging and keyword-based search are inefficient, error-prone, and slow.
Our project is an AI-driven Document Classification and Indexing System that:
Automatically classifies documents into predefined categories.
Extracts metadata and summaries for intelligent indexing.
Enables semantic search for fast and accurate document retrieval.
Ensures security and role-based access.
Provides a user-friendly frontend dashboard for seamless interaction.

Designed for hackathons, this system is lightweight, extendable, and ideal for real-world organizational use.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
### 🔧 Backend (FastAPI)
#### Clone the repo
- 1. git clone https://github.com/yourusername/document-classification.git
- 2. cd document-classification


# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate environment
# Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run server
uvicorn main:app --reload

## 🎨 Frontend (React)
- cd frontend
- npm install
- npm start

##🧪 Usage
-Open the frontend dashboard.
-Upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
-Documents are classified automatically and metadata extracted.
-Use semantic search to find documents based on meaning
-Access restricted based on user role; HR sees HR documents, Finance sees Finance documents.
